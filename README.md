# Statistics in C++
A small project how a statistical calculations can be done in C++ with
the help of some C++ open source libraries. All the libraries are
provided in the project.

## Included Libraries:
- **gnuplot_iostream**: www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream/

## How to run
Using Linux terminal is suggested unless a modified way of compiling
is desired. Run the makefile in the terminal to compile and run the
executable file created in the directory bin.

## Status
- It created data on a hard-disk and read them to plot (suitable for
  large datasets, but slow), then delete the data.
- There is no GUI, it might be added in the future.
