# Statistics in C++
A small project how statistical calculations can be done in C++ with
the help of some C++ open source libraries. All the libraries are
provided in the project.

## Included Libraries:
- **gnuplot_iostream**: www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream/

## How to run
Using Linux terminal is suggested unless a modified way of compiling
is desired. First, run "make" in the terminal to compile and run the
executable file created in the directory bin. To clean the files, run
"make clean".

## Status
- It created data on a hard-disk and read them to plot (suitable for
  large datasets, but slow), then delete the data.
- There is no GUI, it might be added in the future.
